## Doping of Silicon

- Common group V elements used for doping: P and As
  - Others may not be suitable due to size mismatch
- Group V elements give an extra electron which is forced into the conduction band
  - Donor dopant
  - N-type silicon, N for **N**egative carriers
- Common group III elements used for doping: B
- Group III elements have one less electron, creating a hole in the valence band
  - Acceptor dopant
  - P-type silicon, P for **P**ositive carriers

## Dopant States

- Donor dopants have an extra positive charge in the nucleus
  - Stronger attraction to electrons
  - Some electrons can stay in the bandgap where they are not allowed in intrinsic silicon
  - Introduces a **donor energy level** $E_D$
- Acceptor dopants have one less positive charge in the nucleus
  - Weaker attraction to electrons
  - Introduces a loosely bound hole, electrons can stay a bit further away from the nucleus
    at the **acceptor energy level** $E_A$
- $\text{Density of Si atoms} \gg \text{Density of dopants}$ due to solid solubility limit in the amount of dopants that can be taken by silicon **before it loses intrinsic properties**
  - Locations of donor sites are very sparse
  - $E_C - E_D$ is very small, electrons can be easily excited and move around in the conduction band
  - Once the electron comes out of the dip, it may not be distinguished among others
    - We can assume all electrons coming from donor dopants will be delocalized and become electrons in the conduction band
- In N-type silicon, electrons significantly outnumber holes because of donor dopants
  - Electrons are the majority carriers
  - Holes are the minority carriers
- P-type silicon is similar, but with holes as majority carriers and electrons as minority carriers

## Carrier Density

- When doped with both donor and acceptor dopants:
  - **Recombination**: electrons from donor dopants can recombine with holes from acceptor dopants
  - Cancel each other out instead of adding up the number of carriers
- When dopants are added to the system originally at thermal equilibrium (take donor dopants as an example):
  - Holes can more easily recombine with electrons
  - Newly added electrons $\gg$ number of holes
    - Number of electrons does not change much
    - Number of holes decreases significantly
  - At new thermal equilibrium:
    - $pn = n_i^2$ (always the case at thermal equilibrium)
    - $n = p + N_D$ (every hole **must come from an electron**)
    - $N_D \gg p$ (Majority carriers come from dopants)
    - Thus, $p = n_i^2 / N_D$

## Locating the Fermi Level

- For N-type silicon, with additional electrons in the conduction band, the probability of finding an electron in the conduction band increases
  - Temperature is the same, the shape of the Fermi-Dirac distribution does not change
  - The Fermi level must have moved up to increase the probability of finding an electron in the conduction band
  - The Fermi level of intrinsic silicon is marked as $E_i$
  - $$
    \begin{aligned}
      n &= N_C e ^{- \frac{E_C - E_F}{kT}} \\
      n &= N_D \\
      \Rightarrow E_C - E_F &= kT \ln {\frac{N_C}{N_D}}
    \end{aligned}
    $$
  - Equivalent density of states $N_C$ does not change with doping
    $$
      \begin{cases}
        n = N_C e ^{- \frac{E_C - E_F}{kT}} & \text{in N-type silicon} \\
        n_i = N_C e ^{- \frac{E_C - E_i}{kT}} & \text{in intrinsic silicon} \\
      \end{cases}
    $$
  - Dividing the two equations:
    $$
      n = n_i e^{\frac{E_F - E_i}{kT}}
    $$
    or
    $$
      E_F - E_i = kT \ln {\frac{n}{n_i}}
    $$
- For P-type silicon, the Fermi level moves down
  - $$
    \begin{aligned}
      p &= N_V e ^{- \frac{E_F - E_V}{kT}} \\
      p &= N_A \\
      \Rightarrow E_F - E_V &= - kT \ln {\frac{N_V}{N_A}}
    \end{aligned}
    $$
  - $$
    \begin{aligned}
      & \begin{cases}
        p = N_V e^{-\frac{E_F - E_V}{kT}} & \text{in P-type silicon} \\
        p_i = n_i = N_V e^{-\frac{E_i - E_V}{kT}} & \text{in intrinsic silicon} \\
      \end{cases} \\
      \Rightarrow &\quad p = n_i e^{\frac{E_i - E_F}{kT}} \\
      \Rightarrow &\quad E_i - E_F = kT \ln {\frac{p}{n_i}}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

## Water Analogy for Fermi Level

- Water level represents the Fermi level
- When dopants are added, the water level rises or falls
- For N-type silicon, the weight of the box representing the semiconductor increases, pushing the box down and the water level up
- For P-type silicon, the weight of the box decreases, causing the box to rise and the water level to fall
