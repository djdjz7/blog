$$
I_D = I_0\left(e^{\frac{qV_A}{kT}} - 1\right)
$$

$$
I_0 = q \left(D_n\frac{n_{p0}}{L_n} + D_p\frac{p_{n0}}{L_p}\right)

## Mechanism for Minority Carriers

- Doping is asymmetrical, so the current is dominated by the minority carriers on the lightly doped side
  - In the P+/N junction, holes on the N side dominate the current
  - Electrons generally move faster than holes in silicon, so which diode is faster?
    - A. P+/N
    - B. P/N+
    - Answer: @@B@@
    - Analysis: @@We want electrons to dominate the current, and electrons are the minority carriers on the P side, so we make the P side the lightly doped side.@@

## Mechanism for Majority Carriers

What's the driving force for majority carriers?

- When an electron move from N to P, it has two effects:
  - Reduces concentration of electrons on the N side, causing diffusion
  - Results charge imbalance, creating a positive charge behind, causing drift
- The current density:
  - $J_{n,\text{diff}} = q D_n \frac{\mathrm{d}n}{\mathrm{d}x}$
  - $J_{n,\text{drift}} = q \mu_n n E$ where $\mu_n$ is the electron mobility (indicates how easily electrons move in the material)
- On the N side, electrons are majority carriers, so $n$ is very large, while $\mathrm{d}n/\mathrm{d}x$ is small. Thus **drift** is the main driving force
<!--new paragraph-->
- In general:
  - **Diffusion** is the main driving force to move **minority** carriers, because even a large $E$ cannot cause a large current with the limited number of carriers
  - **Drift** is the main driving force to move **majority** carriers, because there are many carriers to move to balance out the effect of the charge imbalance

## Short Diode Current

- When electrons get pushed from N to P, recombination rate will increase with a tendency to restore the equilibrium
- On average, an electron need to travel $L_n$ before recombination
- When the diode is short, the neutral region length $W_p$ and $W_n$ may be smaller than $L_n$ and $L_p$
  - $$W_p < L_n \quad \text{and} \quad W_n < L_p$$
  - Note that the subscript of $L$ is different from that of $W$, as the subscript of $L$ indicates the type of area, and the subscript of $W$ indicates the type of carrier
- In this case, no combination can happen before an electron reaches the end of the diode, and the carrier distribution is a straight line
- At the two ends, the diode contacts with metal, and the carrier concentration is determined by metal, as it has a large number of carriers
- The metal will **force** carrier concentration to become $n_{p0}$ and $p_{n0}$ at the two ends
- The current density becomes:
  $$
    J_{n, \text{diff}} = q D_n \frac{n_{p0}}{W_p}\left(e^{\frac{q V_A}{kT}} - 1\right)
  $$
  $$
    J_{p, \text{diff}} = q D_p \frac{p_{n0}}{W_n}\left(e^{\frac{q V_A}{kT}} - 1\right)
  $$
- The electron current on the P side must be supported by the continuous electron **influx** from the N side, which is driven by **drift**, thus the drift current on the N side equals the diffusion current on the P side
- Similarly, the drift current of holes on the P side equals the diffusion current on the N side
- The total current density is the combination of the two, and must be a constant across the diode

:::info Why Carrier Distribution is a Straight Line

- Within a short diode, no combination will happen, so the current flow must be a constant
- $J_{n, \text{diff}} \propto \frac{\mathrm{d}n}{\mathrm{d}x}$
- Thus, $\frac{\mathrm{d}n}{\mathrm{d}x}$ is a constant, and $n(x)$ is a straight line
- Similar analysis also applies to holes

## Carrier Recombination in Long Diode

- In a long diode, carriers can recombine before reaching the end of the diode
- The carrier distribution is no longer a straight line
- The diffusion current decreases as $x$ moves away from 0
- The total current must be a constant, so the decrease in diffusion current must be compensated by an increase in drift current
- The mechanism behind the increase in drift current:
  - When an electron recombines with a hole, the carriers disappear, leving a **negative** charge behind (a hole is eliminated in the P side neutral region)
  - The negative charge is quickly removed by the nearby holes
  - Eventually, the missing hole must be compensated by an **externally supplied** hole coming from the battery connected to the P+ side
  - This creates the drift current
  - The current can be considered as:
    - By **holes** from the end of P side to the recombination point
    - By **electrons** from the recombination point to the end of N side
    - It's like current changing lanes at the recombination point
    - Whenever a recombination happens, a drift current must be added to the **left**, but not the right, of the recombination point, thus the drift current increases as $x$ moves away from 0

:::warning Does Recombination Increase or Decrease Current?

**Answer: Recombination increases the current.**

- Carriers face higher resistance when moving through low concentration areas
- When electrons move on the N side, they face low resistance, and when they move to the P side, they face higher resistance
- Recombination allows current to switch carriers from electrons to holes, which face lower resistance on the P side
- It provides a mechanism for a higher current flow
<!--new paragraph-->
- By looking at the carrier distribution graph:
  - If there is no recombination, the carrier distribution is a straight line, and $L_n \to \infty$, $L_p \to \infty$, so the gradient is small
  - If there is recombination, $L_n$ and $L_p$ become smaller, so the gradient becomes larger
  - A larger gradient means a larger current
  - This additional current introduced by recombination is referred to as **recombination current**
