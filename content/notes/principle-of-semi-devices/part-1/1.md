## Energy Bands

- When atoms are put together, orbits at the same energy level are combined and form a energy band across the entire crystal.
- Electrons can stay at a wider range of energies instead of just one particular level.
- **Valence Band**: the energy band where electrons are shared.
  - All spaces that can hold electrons are filled with electrons.
- **Conduction Band**: the first empty energy band above the valence band.
  - Almost empty.
- **Band Gap**: the energy difference between the conduction band and the valence band.
  - No electron states exist in this energy range.

## Metal, Insulator, Semiconductor

- **Metal**: valence band is only partially filled.
  - Electrons can move freely to conduct electricity.
- **Insulator**: full valence band and empty conduction band.
  - Cannot conduct electricity.
  - With energy supplied, electrons can be excited to the conduction band.
- **Semiconductor**: similar band diagram as insulator, but with a smaller band gap.
  - Room temperature is enough to excite a considerable amount of electrons to the conduction band.
- Material with a full valence band and an empty conduction band can be insulator or semiconductor, depending on the size of band gap and temperature of the working environment.

## Carrier Motion

- **Diffusion**: particles move from high concentration to low concentration.
- **Drift**: particles move under the influence of an electric field.
- **They can co-exist**: electrons carry charges, accumulation of negative charges raises energy of electrons, which leads to drift and diffusion at the same time.
- Motion of electrons and holes is needed for electrons to move in an energy band, and the motion of the smaller quantity is easier to observe.
<!---->
- In metals, electrons move in the partially filled band, and either electrons or holes are counted.
- In semiconductors, conduction happens both in the conduction band and the valence band, and carriers cannot be mixed. Current is the sum of both electrons and holes.
- The total number of carriers in the semiconductor is still much smaller than that in metals.

## The Water Analogy

- Electrons when voltage is applied -> water molecules moving down the potential
  - **Tend to stay at the lower part of energy band**
- Holes when voltage is applied -> holes moving up the potential
  - **Tend to stay near the top part of energy band**
- Deficiency: water molecules and bubbles are electrically neutral, while electrons and holes are charged.
