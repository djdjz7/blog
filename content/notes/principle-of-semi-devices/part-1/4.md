## Doping of the PN Junction

- **Diode**: Putting P-type and N-type silicon together, forming a PN junction.
- Recall **recombination**:
  - When electrons coming from donors meet holes from acceptor, recombination happens.
  - After recombination, location of dopants carries a small positive charge, and location of acceptors carries a small negative charge.
- When we put P-type silicon on the left, and N-type silicon on the right:
  ```plaintext
     P   |   N
  . . . .|. . . .
  ```
  we assume that recombination happens in an orderly manner, starting from the interface of the two types of silicon (the junction).
  ```plaintext
     P   |   N
  . . . -|+ . . .
  ```
  ```plaintext
     P   |   N
  . . - -|+ + . .
      ^^^^^^^
     depletion region
  ```
  areas near the junction are depleted of free carriers, forming a **depletion region**, where generally assumed to have no carriers.
  - Covalence bounds are similar to intrinsic silicon.
  - Assumption is not accurate, as there are still carriers in intrinsic silicon
  - The number is much smaller than the number of those added by doping, so we can ignore them.
- As recombination happens, charges accumulates, which tend to oppose further diffusion of carriers across the junction.
- An equilibrium will be reached eventually, with a particular depletion width.
- Simplifications we made:
  - **Abrupt junction approximation**: Assumes there is a clear boundary between P-type and N-type silicon, where a transition region (both donors and acceptors exist) exists in reality.
  - **Depletion approximation**: Assumes the depletion region is fully devoid of charge carriers and there is a clear boundary between the depletion region and the neutral region.

## Band Diagram of the PN Junction

- When PN junction is formed, the Fermi levels of P-type and N-type silicon must align at equilibrium.
- In P side, $E_i > E_F$
- In N side, $E_i < E_F$
- The built-in potential $V_{bi}$ satisfies:
  $$qV_{bi} = qV_p + qV_n$$
  where $qV_p = E_{i_P} - E_F$, $qV_n = E_F - E_{i_N}$
- $$
     \begin{cases}
     E_{i_P} - E_F = kT \ln{\frac{N_A}{n_i}} \\
     E_F - E_{i_N} = kT \ln{\frac{N_D}{n_i}}
     \end{cases}
  $$
- Therefore,
  $$V_{bi} = \frac{kT}{q} \ln{\frac{N_A N_D}{n_i^2}}$$

## Calculating the Depletion Region Width

- Depletion region width $x_d = x_p + x_n$
- Charge neutrality:
  $$
    \begin{equation}
      N_A x_p = N_D x_n
    \end{equation}
  $$
- Charge density:
  $$
     \rho(x) =
     \begin{cases}
        -q N_A, & -x_p < x < 0 \\
        +q N_D, & 0 < x < x_n \\
        0, & \text{elsewhere}
     \end{cases}
  $$
- Using Poisson's equation:
  $$
    \nabla^2 V = -\frac{\rho}{\varepsilon}
  $$
- In 1D:
  $$
    \frac{d^2 V}{dx^2} = -\frac{\rho}{\varepsilon}
  $$
- Integrate twice:
  $$
   \begin{equation}
    V_{bi} = \frac{q N_A x_p^2}{2\varepsilon_{\text{Si}}} + \frac{q N_D x_n^2}{2\varepsilon_{\text{Si}}}
   \end{equation}
  $$
- Solve with equation (1) and (2):
  $$
    x_p = \sqrt{\frac{2\varepsilon_{\text{Si}} V_{bi}}{q} \cdot \frac{N_D}{N_A (N_A + N_D)}}
  $$
  $$
    x_n = \sqrt{\frac{2\varepsilon_{\text{Si}} V_{bi}}{q} \cdot \frac{N_A}{N_D (N_A + N_D)}}
  $$
- Finally:
  $$
    x_d = \sqrt{\frac{2\varepsilon_{\text{Si}} V_{bi}}{q}\left( \frac{1}{N_A} + \frac{1}{N_D} \right)}
  $$
  where
  $$
  V_{bi} = \frac{kT}{q} \ln{\frac{N_A N_D}{n_i^2}}
  $$

:::info If you are an idiot just like me...

When $a > 0$ and $b > 0$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \sqrt{\frac{a}{b(a + b)}} + \sqrt{\frac{b}{a(a + b)}} \\
= & \frac{\sqrt{a ^ 2} + \sqrt{b ^ 2}}{\sqrt{ab(a + b)}} \\
=& \sqrt{\frac{a + b}{ab}}
\end{aligned}
$$

## One-Sided PN Junction

- Doping on two sides are asymmetrical
  - Usually, a PN junction is formed by counter doping to convert part of a material to the opposite type
  - Counter doping concentration is much higher to minimize the background dopants
- In the depletion region expression, higher doping concentration term can be removed, and the depletion region width is mainly controlled by the lightly doped side
  - Graphically, the depletion region extends much more into the lightly doped side (PN junction is one-sided)

## Measuring the Built-in Potential

- The built-in potential cannot be measured directly with a voltmeter
- The potential difference will be canceled out by the contact potential when the voltmeter is connected
